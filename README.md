# exploring_pokemon
On this repository I tried to explore the pokemon dataset to its fullest. My end goal was trying to optimize my pokemon choices for Heart Gold game.
I am going to use a data analytics methodology in order to choose my team.

Some background on it...
I bought a copy of Heart Gold and was having fun initiating my pokemon journey through Kanto. However I noticed this game was a little bit more challenging than its original counterpart from Game Boy Color. So I will need some planning on my pokemon roster. That's when data analytics comes in!
